# Cult Meeting

Category: Reversing
Difficulty: Easy

# Description

After months of research, you're ready to attempt to infiltrate the meeting of a shadowy cult. Unfortunately, it looks like they've changed their password!

# Solve

We are given an Elf Binary.

```
[alex@alex-manjaro rev_cult_meeting]$ file meeting 
meeting: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=72d8b06e4ca750d5c24395d3349c3121b9b95283, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

And when we run the binary, it asks for a password. Intially before attempted to decompile, and actually reverse the binary, I run strings, to see if it
is possible that the password is stored as an unobfiscated string. 

```
[alex@alex-manjaro rev_cult_meeting]$ strings meeting

"What is the password for this week's meeting?" 
sup3r_s3cr3t_p455w0rd_f0r_u!
```

And it seems like an unobfiscated string is exactly what we have here! Pass that in as the password, and reveal the flag.
