Description: Can you convert the number 27 (base 10) to binary (base 2)? 
Hint(s): (1) Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. 
For example, if you answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

## Solution

We can do this by hand, or use an online tool. I used this: https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html
