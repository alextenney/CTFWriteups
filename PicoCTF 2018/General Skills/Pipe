# Pipe

CTF: PicoCTF 2018. 
Category: General Skills
Points: 110
Description: During your adventure, you will likely encounter a situation where you need to process data that you receive over the 
network rather than through a file. Can you find a way to save the output from this program and search for the flag? Connect with 
2018shell.picoctf.com 44310.
Hint(s): (1) Remember the flag format is picoCTF{XXXX} (2) Ever heard of a pipe? No not that kind of pipe... This kind [1] 

## Solution

When you netcat into this, it prints when seems to be a neverending series of "this isn't a flag". Instead, pipe it with that grep command:

nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 44310 | grep pico 

and it will return the flag.
