Description: Can you find the flag in file [1] ? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. 
You can also find the file in /problems/grep-1_2_ee2b29d2f2b29c65db957609a3543418 on the shell server.
Hint(s): (1) grep tutorial [2] 

## Solution

Use the shell to cd into /problems/grep-1_2_ee2b29d2f2b29c65db957609a3543418 on the pico shell, and use the ls command to find file. Using
the command:

strings file | grep pico

the flag is returned.
