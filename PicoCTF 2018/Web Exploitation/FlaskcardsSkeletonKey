## Solution

We need to become an admin here, and are given a key. When we look at cookies, theres an encoded session cookie : .eJwlz0FqAzEMQNG7eJ2FJVm

the following website: https://www.kirsle.net/wizards/flask-session.cgi

The following script was adapted from https://github.com/d4rkvaibhav and is used to change the userId to a 1, using the key given. We can 
now change out cookie to reflect what an admin's session cookie would look like.
