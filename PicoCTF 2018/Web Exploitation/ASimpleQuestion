## Solution

When you answer the question with any string of text, you get the answer wrong, but the website also returns "SQL query: SELECT 
* FROM answers WHERE answer='a'", so we know how its searching for the answer. Here I tried to do a SQL Injection. But it returns a scary
error:


Warning: SQLite3::query(): Unable to prepare statement: 1, near "a": syntax error in /problems/a-simple-question_0_cb5aee694c05cc51db8ca0e
fccc19133/webroot/answer2.php on line 15

Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to a member function fetchArray() on boolean in /problems/a-simple-question_0_cb5aee694c05cc51db8ca0ef

answer2.php on line 17

If you try a bunch of different kind of SQL Injections, specifically ' union SELECT answer from answers where answer like '%
eventually you get a response from the system of: You are so Close. We can get closer, guessing ' union SELECT answer from answers where 
answer like '4%

It seems we need to write a scrypt. My script was taken from https://github.com/d4rkvaibhav. It gives us (once ran through his order.py)
the answer 41AndSixSixths
